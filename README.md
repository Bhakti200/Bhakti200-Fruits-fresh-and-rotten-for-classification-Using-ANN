   The "Fruits Fresh and Rotten for Classification" dataset contains over 6,000 images of apples, bananas, and oranges, categorized as fresh or rotten across six classes. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), this dataset can be leveraged for fruit quality classification. Images are preprocessed (resized and normalized), and features like color and texture are analyzed to distinguish freshness. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, and an ANN model can be trained with layers for feature extraction and classification. This system is useful for automating fruit quality control in industries and supermarkets.
